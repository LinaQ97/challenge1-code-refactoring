# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

 This project helped me understand how to properly exploit content to Git from our code factor. Creating multiple locations in which to store our code for further use. This lesson also helped me understand the way multiple users can assist in a project while using Git. Getting to know the fundamentals of an HTML will help me understand the future topics and projects I will be working on this course and possible future life situations as well.
